# Data Analytics Summer Bootcamp

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vanshika Pandey and this repository contains everything I worked on during my *Data Analytics Summer Bootcamp*.

Throughout the bootcamp, I explored how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data using tools like *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and **Excel*. Every week came with new challenges and hands-on tasks that helped me improve my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
